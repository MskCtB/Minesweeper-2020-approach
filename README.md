# Minesweeper-2020-approach
Different approach to my old minesweeper code

Press >spacebar< to get a different mine layout/restart the game.
Press >Escape< to get back to the menu.

To do:
-add animations to explosion(?)
-add sounds(?)
-make "colour" and "flash" variables useful as well as add functionality to "Colour" function 


Don't ask me why I named a variable for square "CUBE"
